Code that doesn't have a home but will be re-used and possibly improved

```
└─ bioinformatic_workflows // notebooks for more active analyses (e.g. Single cell, spatial, TCR)
└─ compute_environments    // Docker setups, server initiation, etc.
└─ software_invocations    // bash scripts to execute standalone software (e.g. cellranger)
└─ misc
